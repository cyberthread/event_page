# Event Landing Page
Introduce us to your event. What is the event? What will happen at the event? When is it? Where is it? Why should we come? This could be any kind of event: a one-day conference, a workshop, a talk, a crafting hour, a happy hour.

Your event landing page should introduce us to the event and have a call to action to register. You do not need to create the registration component, which is often handled by a third party (like Eventbrite, or zoom, etc.). Most short events (1-day or shorter) often have a one-page website.

## Requirements
### Content
- [ ] Event overview and information: who is hosting, what the event is, when it is, where it is, why attend.
- [ ] Call to action to register

### Technical
- [ ] HTML is valid (submit screenshot)
- [ ] CSS is valid (submit screenshot)
- [ ] Passes [Accessibility Audit](https://oswego.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1MQFgEWOOxOFN0a) (submit report -- note you will get an email with a summary of your responses, you'll want to use the link at the top that says "Link to view results" to get the full report)
- [ ] Coded mobile-first with fluid layouts and relative units
- [ ] Site is live (in docs folder in GitHub Repository)

### Process 
- [ ] Document your process in a Miro Whiteboard
- [ ] Collect multiple examples of event web pages for reference
- [ ] Sketch design ideas across multiple screen sizes. Explore multiple options at each screen size.
- [ ] Ask for and record (take notes on) feedback from at least two peers
- [ ] Code was written in chunks and committed to GitHub when individual components were complete. Example: a commit for the HTML, a commit for typography, a commit for mobile layout, a commit for medium screen layouts, a commit for large screens, etc.
- [ ] Images and content are properly documented in a [copyright documentation spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hWHAFldySHAPDUjdQ2PwHVHf7rTKbuX5fZdCbB4xI5A/copy)

### Design
Typography is important, but you'll notice an emphasis on composition. Take risks.
- [ ] Design works well on small screens (easy to read/browse and navigate)
- [ ] Design works well on a range of medium-sized screens (easy to read/browse and navigate)
- [ ] Design works well on large screens (think 24" wide with over 5000px). The design should take advantage of the physical space available.
- [ ] Composition is interesting and unique (it doesn't replicate everything we've seen before)
- [ ] Design uses imagery in a powerful and interesting way (and doesn't replicate everything we've seen before)
